# Green Knight API

API provides basic methods for creating secure links and user authorization.

API methods are open and can be used by other apps, for example, to independently check the balance of users on their own. First you need to create a secret link through the web interface of the service.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```
yarn start
```

Runs the app in the development mode on port 5000.  
The server app will reload if you make edits (nodemon).

```
docker image build .
```

To build docker image for backend API.
