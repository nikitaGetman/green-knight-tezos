# Green Knight bots

Community bots will help you manage community members. You can create special communities for users with a certain number of tokens and add a bot as an administrator. The bot will manage the participants. Add users only with a sufficient balance of target tokens. Delete users after their balance has fallen below the required level.

Supported platforms:

- [Telegram](./telegram/)
- [Discord](./discord/)
